# Notifier Function App
This guide will explain how to use the Notifier function, found in Notifier/Function

## Prerequisites
* Visual Studio (tested in VS 2022, but likely works with other versions as well)
* Download the latest version of the public Github repository from: https://github.com/microsoftgraph/group-membership-management
* Ensure that GMM is already set up in your environment, as you will need some of the values from your gmm-data-<env> keyvault for the console app
* Ensure that you have configured [sender address for email notification](../../../Repositories.Mail/Documentation/SetSenderAddressForEmailNotification.md).
